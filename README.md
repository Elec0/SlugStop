# SlugStop
Android app to track UCSC buses in real time

The old Slug Route app is broken and dead, so I made a new one!

This app tracks the Loop buses via their real-time GPS data which is thanks to the Bus Tracking System (BTS), launched by UCSC Transportation & Parking Services (TAPS).

You can tap on any of the markers to view more data about them, specifically the bus stops to see the name and whether they are on the inner or outer loop routes.
